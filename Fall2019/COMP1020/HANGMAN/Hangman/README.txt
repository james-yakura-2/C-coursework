Evil Hangman
Author: James Yakura

To build this program, use the following Linux commands while in its directory. Keep in mind that you will need to log in in order to use sudo.

sudo chmod +x ./rebuild.sh
./rebuild.sh

After doing this, you will be running Evil Hangman under valgrind. To run it normally afterward, use 
./string_driver.


The following problems were encountered while creating this program:
The lab detailing AssociativeArray was never posted; substantial delay was incurred while waiting for it.
Due to time constraints and related cross-platform issues, no testing was possible.
The lab detailing AVLTree was never posted; it is unclear how an AVL tree is relevant here or should be used.
